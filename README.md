# kasi-kule - CAM02 color spaces, now in rust!
kasi-kule is a small rust implementation of the [CIECAM02 color space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIECAM02) and conversion to it from standard RGB.
It is based on the [d3-cam02](https://github.com/connorgr/d3-cam02/) and [colorspacious](https://github.com/njsmith/colorspacious).

The name, kasi-kule, is a translation of 'flower' into toki pona - literally, 'colorful plant'.
